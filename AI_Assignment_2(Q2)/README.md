## Carrer Expert System for College Students based on Experta

Expert Systems use AI to model human behaviour who has expertise in a certain field and give suggestions related to the field.
Expert Systems shells are shells which already have the structure and interface writtern, we need to add the Knowledge into them. This file contains the code for such a **Career Expert System** which can recommend the set of courses a student needs to take over a period of 4 years that can land him into an IT job, research job or management related career. </br>

The Sytem is built using [Experta](https://experta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python library for building expert systems. The designed system can also suggest hobbies or clubs one can be a part of to increase exposure towards his desired career path. Various factors like GPA, publications, awards etc. are taken into consideration by the expert system.

To run the code just run the following command
```
 python AI_Assignment_2(Q2).py
```
